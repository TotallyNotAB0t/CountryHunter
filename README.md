First programming project ever in Python, for school in a group of 3. Extremly clunky and not optimized at all, I leave it here because we all started somewhere. Maybe I will remake it someday.

To play, you must chose a difficulty under the "Classique" tab, on the top left of the window. Don't mind the bugs. :)
